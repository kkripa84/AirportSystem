# AirportSystem

Submitted by Radhakrishnan Krishna Kripa

I used hardcoded values in the Main testAlgo java class.  Sample input is avaialble in the document provided. 

Input: The input consists of several sections.  The beginning of each section is marked by a line starting: “# Section:”
Section 1: A weighted bi-directional graph describing the conveyor system.
Format: <Node 1> <Node 2> <travel_time>
Section 2: Departure list Format:
<flight_id> <flight_gate> <destination> <flight_time>
Section 3: Bag list Format: 		
<bag_number> <entry_point> <flight_id>
 
Output: The optimized route for each bag
<Bag_Number> <point_1> <point_2> [<point_3>, …] : <total_travel_time>

The output should be in the same order as the Bag list section of the input.
